\begin{rubriquetableau}[0.95\textwidth]{Summary}\\
  \vspace{-0.5cm}
    
I  am a  Ph.D. quantitative  researcher  in macro-finance,  fluent in  Chinese
Mandarin, English  and French. I work  for ADIA, the sovereign  wealth fund of
Abu Dhabi.\\ \medskip

I  am part  of ADIA's  quant  team ("Q").   I  work on  assets allocation  and
quantitative  total  portfolio, as  well  as  on macro-signal  generation  for
systematic trading.\\ \medskip

I use  alternative and standard  data, statistics (frequentist  and Bayesian),
and machine learning, mostly in the time series space.  I develop Python tools
for macro-financial signals generation and portfolio construction. \\
